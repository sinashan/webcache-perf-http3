# ðŸš€ HTTP/3 Detector

This is a simple yet effective Python tool to detect if a website supports **HTTP/3**. It checks both the **Alt-Svc (Alternative Services) HTTP response header** and **DNS HTTPS records** to determine support. If either method detects `h3`, it is highly likely that the website supports HTTP/3. The tool can be useful for developers and network engineers working with next-gen internet protocols.
